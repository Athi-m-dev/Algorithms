# Example 1:
            Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
            Output: 1
            Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
            And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
            You need to output 1.
            Example 2:
# Example 2:
            Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
            Output: 2
            Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
            You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
            You need to output 2.

```java 
  class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        int m = g.length;
        int n = s.length;
        int l = 0 , r = 0;
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);

        while (r < m && l < n) {
            if (s[l] >= g[r]) {
                r++;
            }
            l++;
        }
        return r;
    }
}
```

# why this is the greedy approach?
  We sort both the greed factors and the cookie sizes.
  so we can try to satisfy the least greedy child first with the smallest available cookie.
  if we assign the largest cookie to the least greedy child, we might waste a larger cookie that could have satisfied a more greedy child.
  By sorting both arrays, we ensure that we are always trying to satisfy the least greedy child with the smallest available cookie, which is a greedy choice that leads to an optimal solution.

# Time Complexity: O(n log n + m log m)
   Sorting both arrays takes O(n log n) and O(m log m) time respectively.
   The while loop runs in O(n + m) time, where n is the length of the greed factors array and m is the length of the cookie sizes array.
